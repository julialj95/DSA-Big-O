1. a. O(1) b. O(n)

2. O(1) -- The function only accepts a single value as an argument and then checks one thing (if it is divisible by 2). No matter what value is sent the function will take the same amount of time.

3. O(n^2) -- This function has a nested loop.

4. O(n) -- This function accepts an array and iterates over each item in the array. The time required to complete the function is proportional to the size of the array.

5.
