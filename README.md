# DSA-Big-O

1. a. O(1) b. O(n)

2. Even or odd -- O(1) -- The function only accepts a single value as an argument and then checks one thing (if it is divisible by 2). No matter what value is sent the function will take the same amount of time.

3. Are you here? -- O(n^2) -- This function has a nested loop.

4. Doubler -- O(n) -- This function accepts an array and iterates over each item in the array. The time required to complete the function is proportional to the size of the array.

5. Naive Search -- O(n) -- Same reason as number 4. 

6. Create Pairs -- O(n^2) -- This function has a nested loop. 

7. Compute the Sequence -- O(n) -- This function creates a fibonacci sequence with the number of items being equivalent to the num passed as an argument. Therefore the time required to complete the function depends on the value of the num argument. The higher the number, the longer the function will take to run. 

8. ?

9. Random Element -- O(1) -- The function is returning a single random number. The size of the input doesn't matter. 

10. What am I? -- O(1) -- This function returns true if the num input is a prime number and false if it is not. Because it receives a single value as an argument, its run time is O(1).
